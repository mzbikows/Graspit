/*! \file
	This file in intended to define a HumanHand subclass from Hand, to 
	encapsulate the specific characteristics for building an accurate 
	model of a human hand. However, this is not complete, and not really
	used yet.

	The main feature that is actually implemented here are tendons. We 
	define all the frameworks for defining tendons in a hand, as a list
	if insertion points and wrappers. You can visualize tendons and also
	use them to actuate the hand, but only in the dynamics engine. 
	However, this work is not complete. The human hand model that is 
	delivered with GraspIt actually does not use this (yet). 

	Other features, such as soft fingers, have found their way out of
	the human hand as they are used for robotic hands as well.

	points are also the only points where a tendon can apply force
	to the link. They are also called "pulleys" on occasion in the
