For an introduction to GraspIt!, the most complete overview of its
core features is in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Andrew Miller and Peter K. Allen. ``Graspit!: A Versatile
  Simulator for Robotic Grasping''. IEEE Robotics and Automation
  Magazine, V. 11, No.4, Dec. 2004, pp. 110-122.
\end{itemize}

We recommend starting with that paper for the best introduction to the
system. Most of the papers below address individual features of the
simulator, you can read those that are relevant to the particular
project you are working on. The list of publication is presented in
chronological order, from oldest to newest. For each publication, we
also provide a short description of the parts of GraspIt! that it is
most relevant for.

Computations". In Proceedings IEEE International Conference on
Robotics and Automation, Detroit, MI, pp. 1240-1246, May 1999.

Introductory theory on the grasp quality metrics used by
GraspIt!. Discussed topics such as the Grasp Wrench Space, L1 and LInf
norms, epsilon and volume quality metrics, etc.

\item Andrew T. Miller. "GraspIt!: A Versatile Simulator for Robotic
Grasping", Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Science, Columbia
University, June 2001.

Extremely detailed presentation of the GraspIt! core. The presentation
is mostly from a theoretical and research standpoint, but also covers
a number of practical implementation issues.

meets online grasp planning". In Proceedings IEEE International
Conference on Robotics and Automation, Seoul, Republic of Korea,
pp. 2460-2465, May 2001.

Application of GraspIt! to execute a grasping task with a real
robot. A real-life object is tracked using a camera, its position is
replicated in GraspIt! where a grasp is planned using a virtual
Barrett hand. The grasp is then executed using a real Barrett hand.

Presents the theoretical framework between the dynamics engine in
GraspIt!. Covers topics such as time step integration, formulation of
contact and joint constraints as Linear Complementarity constraints,
etc. Shows how the full Linear Complementarity problem is assembled and
solved at each time step of the dynamic engine. A must-read for
understanding GraspIt! dynamics.

Proposed the use of GraspIt! to generate large amounts labeled
grasping data that can be used to apply machine learning
algorithms. This code is not included in the current GraspIt!
distribution.

Discusses the Soft Finger contact as implemented in GraspIt!, covering
the analytical surface approximation, soft finger grasp wrench space
and formulation as linear complementarity constraints.

space as an optimization problem solved through Simulated
Annealing. This is the recommended starting point if you are
interested in eigengrasps.

These two papers show how GraspIt! can be used to generate a huge
database of labeled grasp data, and how this database can be used for
data-driven grasp planning algorithms. The database is \xlink{publicly
  available}{http://grasping.cs.columbia.edu}. GraspIt! also provides
an interface for accessing and using this information; see the
\link{Columbia Grasp Database}{sec:cgdb} chapter in this manual.
