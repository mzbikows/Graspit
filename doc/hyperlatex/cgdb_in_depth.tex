\section{The Columbia Grasp Database: Part II}
\label{sec:cgdb2}

\htmlmenu{2}

\subsection{Overview}

This section contains material describing the CGDB's internal
structure. It is intended for those who wish to modify the CGDB or use
it in more advanced ways than the basic database browser described in
\link{The Columbia Grasp Database - Part I}{sec:cgdb}. For the
remainder of this chapter, when we say the "CGDB" we are referring to
the PostgreSQL database, and not to the accompanying geometry files
that the database references.

The CGDB is not only of data, but also a database in the strong sense;
a structured system for encapsulating relationships between various
types of geometric, semantic, and robotic data. The preloaded data
consists of grasps computed by our Eigengrasps Planner on the models
from the Princeton Shape Benchmark with a small number of hands, but
the structure can be expanded with new data in any dimension. Using
the CGDB to the fullest extent requires a substantial knowledge of
SQL, both to add new information to the system and to calculate
statistics and properties of the grasps.

The CGDB follows the following naming conventions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item every column name is prefixed with the name of its table
	\item except for fields referencing the primary key of another table
\end{itemize}

Some tables contain two unique columns. Columns that end with the
suffix "\_id" are numeric automatically generated identifiers and are
used as primary keys. Columns that end with the suffix "\_name" are
human-readable identifiers intended to simplify interaction with the
database from code and from the \emph{GraspIt!} browser.

\subsection{3D Models}
We first describe how 3D model information is stored in the database.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{original\_model} contains one entry for each geometry file.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{original\_model\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{original\_model\_name} is a convenient
              human-readable name for the model. For the models
              included with the CGDB this is just the model number
              from the PSB.
			\item \emph{original\_model\_geometry\_path} and
              \emph{original\_model\_thumbnail\_path} contain the
              paths - relative to the \texttt{CGDB\_MODEL\_ROOT}
              environment variable - to the geometry file and an
              associated thumbnail file.
			\item \emph{original\_model\_tags} contains an array of
              text tags that refer to the model. For the models that
              come with the CGDB, this field is populated with the
              names of the classes and subclasses in the Princeton
              Shape Benchmark's fine level classification that apply
              to this model.
			\item \emph{original\_model\_grasping\_rescale} gives a
              conversion from the units in the geometry file to
              millimeters, where the model is at its "graspable size"
              as discussed in the \link{previous
                chapter}{sec:cgdb}. For most PSB models we took the
              units in the original file to be 10 inches.
			\item \emph{original\_approximate\_radius} contains a
              statistical measure of the scale of the original
              model. We assume that all points on the surface of a
              mesh are normally distributed around a sphere of fixed
              radius centered on the center of mass. This value is
              that radius, plus 2 standard deviations of that
              distribution. It is used by the CGDB planner to find
              models at "similar" sizes to other models.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \strong{scaled\_model} contains one entry for each scaled
      copy of an original model. Since grasping is scale-dependent, we
      duplicate original models at multiple scales (in this release,
      0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 times the original scale).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{scaled\_model\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{scaled\_model\_name} contains a human-readable
              name for the scaled model. Following the current
              convention ("collectionname\_scale\_modelname") is a
              good idea.
			\item \emph{scaled\_model\_scale} contains the rescale
              factor relative to the original model.
			\item\emph{original\_model\_id} is a foreign key on the
              \emph{original\_model}table, linking this scaled model
              to an unscaled original model.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Adding new models}
To add new models to the CGDB, first place the geometry files (and
preferably, thumbnails) under the \texttt{CGDB\_MODEL\_ROOT}
directory. Then, create a row in \emph{original\_model} referencing
the new files. There is no need to follow the PSB naming convention
for files as long as the path are stored correctly in the
database. Make sure to store the units-to-millimeters conversion in
\emph{original\_model\_grasping\_rescale} and the approximate radius
in \emph{original\_model\_approximate\_radius}. Unfortunately we are
not currently providing code for computing the approximate radius, but
the description of the method above should help those who wish to
recreate it.

The next step is to add at least one row, to \emph{scaled\_model}, or
as many rows as you like. (You can also add new \emph{scaled\_model}
rows for existing models in the database at new scales.) After that,
the model is in the database and will be visible to the browser and to
all CGDB code, although it will not yet have any associated grasps,
alignments, or neighbors.


\subsection{Robotic Hands}
In this section we describe how hands are stored in the database.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{hand} contains one entry for each robotic hand used
      in the database by any grasp. We store a unique hand if any
      parameter has changed, so for example the Barrett Hand with
      different friction coefficients appears more than once.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{hand\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{hand\_name} is a convenient human-readable
              name for the hand.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Adding new hands}
At the moment, the hand information is tightly coupled to
\emph{GraspIt!}. While it is possible to add new hands to the database
without doing anything in GraspIt!, the only way to link a database
hand to a \emph{GraspIt!} hand model is to edit the code. This is not
particularly difficult, but we should fix it in the future.



\subsection{Grasps}
Now that we have models and hands, we can talk about storing grasps.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{grasp\_source} lists the possible sources of
      grasps. The primary source of grasps in the CGDB is from the
      Eigengrasp Planner, but there are some human-created grasp
      sources as well. In theory a database-backed planner can
      prioritize different sources, say for example preferring human
      created grasps to automatically created grasps when both are
      available. Our current planner only uses the automated grasps
      and so does not do this.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{grasp\_source\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{grasp\_source\_name} is a convenient
              human-readable name for the grasp source.
			\item \emph{grasp\_source\_description} is a free-form
              field for more in depth comments.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \strong{grasp} contains one entry for each grasp done with a
      hand on a model in the database.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{grasp\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{scaled\_model\_id} references the scaled model
              the grasp was performed on.
			\item \emph{hand\_id} references the hand used to perform the grasp.
			\item \emph{grasp\_source\_id} references the
              grasp\_source where this grasp was created from.
			\item \emph{grasp\_pregrasp\_joints} and
              \emph{grasp\_pregrasp\_position} contain the information
              necessary to recreate the pregrasp.
			\item \emph{grasp\_grasp\_joints} and
              \emph{grasp\_grasp\_position} contain the information
              necessary to recreate the grasp.
			\item \emph{grasp\_contacts} is an array of contact points
              between the hand and object. Each three numbers forms an
              (x,y,z) triple.
			\item \emph{grasp\_epsilon\_quality} and
              \emph{grasp\_volume\_quality} contain Ferrari-Canny
              grasp quality measures.

		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adding new grasp sources}
If you wish to add data from your own planner to the CGDB, we suggest
you create a new entry in \emph{grasp\_source}.

\subsubsection{Adding new grasps}
If you wish to add new grasps to the CGDB, you must fill in the
various fields of this table with the grasp information. The
coordinate system of the grasp positions is the model's coordinate
system.


\subsection{Neighbors}
Aside from model and grasp information, the CGDB also stores geometric
relationships between 3D models to assist in grasp planning. If you
wish to use \emph{GraspIt!}'s built-in CGDB planner on new models that
were not distributed with the PSB, you will need to add information to
this part of the database.

In this section we describe how geometric neighbors are stored in the
database. We store neighbors according to a number of "distance
functions" that measure the similarities between 3D models. At this
time, we do not provide code for calculating such similarities
yourself, but only precomputed neighbor relationships for the existing
models. We are distributing 9 sets of neighbors for each model, as
given by the following distance functions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item ZERNIKE - Novotni and Klein's Zernike descriptors, as
      described
      \xlink{here}{http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/publications/paper-details/novotni-2003-3d/}.
	\item RANDOM - randomly selected neighbors for benchmarking
      purposes.
	\item PSB - neighbors within the same subclass in the PSB as the
      current model. The ordering within the classes is
      arbitrary. Used for benchmarking.
	\item SIFT\_12\_view\_x - A SIFT-PI descriptor, as described in
      the CGDB publications, which describes similarity using only
      what is visible from one side of the object. There are 6 such
      distance function in the database with different view numbers,
      and they correspond to descriptors taken from the centers of the
      6 sides of the enclosing box.
\end{itemize}
For each distance function we store the 25 nearest neighbors of each
object, along with the distance to the neighbor (higher distance is
less similar). Note that the neighbor relationships are between
\emph{original} models and not scaled models, since most measures of
3D similarity are scale independent.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{distance\_function} contains an entry for each
      similarity metric used in comparing 3D models and finding
      neighbors. Currently we provide 9 such distance functions (the
      10th, "Eigengrasps", is not actually a distance function and is
      used as a marker in some experiments that pit the Eigengrasp
      Planner against the Database Planner.)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{distance\_function\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{distance\_function\_name} is a convenient
              human-readable name for the distance function.
			\item \emph{distance\_function\_description} is a more
              detailed comment about the distance function.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \strong{neighbors} contains an entry for each neighbor
      relationship between two models in the database.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{neighbor\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{original\_model\_id} references the model we
              are finding neighbors for
			\item \emph{neighbor\_original\_model\_id} references the
              model that has been found as a neighbor
			\item \emph{distance\_function\_id} references the
              distance function used in finding this neighbor
			\item \emph{neighbor\_distance} gives the distance to the
              neighbor (higher is less similar)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Adding new distance functions}
To add a new distance function, simply add a new entry to the
\emph{distance\_function} table. This is useful if you want to try
your own shape matching functions.

\subsubsection{Adding new neighbors}
To add a new neighbor to the database, fill in a new row in the
\emph{neighbor} table. Note that neighbor relationships are not
automatically symmetric, and so if you want the reverse relationship
to be in the database as well you must add it yourself. As we do not
provide the original descriptors or code used in creating the
neighbors we have distributed, we strongly recommend not adding any
new neighbors to the original distance functions. If you wish to add
new models, we encourage you to create a new distance function for all
the models, including those we have distributed.



\subsection{Alignments}
To transfer grasps from one model to another we need a transformation
between their coordinate systems. The CGDB currently provides
precomputed rotational alignments for all neighbor relationships that
are in the database; translational alignments are done by colocating
the models' centers of mass. At the moment, we do not provide the
alignment code itself. We currently provide data from 2 alignment
methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item TRIMESH\_LIB PCA - Models are aligned by aligning their
      principle axes. The \xlink{Trimesh
        library}{http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/trimesh/} was
      used to calculate PCAs.
	\item SIFT\_FULL\_ICP - A SIFT - based alignment, as described in
      the CGDB publications, refined by ICP.
\end{itemize}

The database structure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{alignment\_method} contains an entry for each method
      of computing alignments.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{alignment\_method\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{alignment\_method\_name} is a convenient
              human-readable name for the alignment method.
			\item \emph{distance\_function\_description} is a more
              detailed comment about the alignment method.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \strong{alignment} contains an entry for each stored
      alignment between two models in the database.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{alignment\_id} is a primary key
			\item \emph{original\_model\_id} references the model we
              are trying to align (the one whose coordinates change)
			\item \emph{alignment\_original\_model\_id} references the
              model that we are aligning to (the one whose coordinates
              remain fixed)
			\item \emph{alignment\_method\_id} references the
              alignment method used in creating this alignment.
			\item \emph{aignment} gives the transformation as a matrix
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adding new alignment methods}
To add a new distance function, simply add a new entry to the
\emph{alignment\_method} table.

\subsubsection{Adding new alignments}
To add a new alignment to the database, fill in a new row in the
\emph{alignment} table. Note that alignments are not automatically
symmetric, and so if you want the reverse relationship to be in the
database as well you must add it yourself. As we do not provide the
code used in creating the alignments we have distributed, we strongly
recommend not adding any new alignments to the original alignment
methods.


\subsection{Stored Procedures}
Along with the data and table structures, several stored procedures
are built into the database to ease use. We briefly describe them
here:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \strong{get\_model\_id} turns a scaled\_model\_name into a
      scaled\_model\_id
	\item \strong{get\_hand\_id} turns a hand\_name into a scaled\_model\_id
	\item \strong{get\_source\_id} turns a grasp\_source\_name into a
      grasp\_source\_id
	\item \strong{get\_alignment\_method\_names} retrieves a list of
      alignment method names
	\item \strong{get\_distance\_function\_names} retrieves a list of
      distance function names
	\item \strong{get\_grasp\_type\_names} retrieves a list of grasp type names
	\item \strong{get\_models} retrieves basic information about all
      scaled models.
	\item \strong{get\_model\_at\_nearest\_scales} retrieves the largest
      scaled version of an original model with approximate radius
      smaller than a given radius, and the smallest version larger
      than that radius. One of these may not exist (if the radius is
      larger than the largest scaled model, or smaller than the
      smallest).
	\item \strong{get\_saved\_neighbors} retrieves a list of saved
      neighbors for a given model
	\item \strong{get\_grasps} retrieves a list of saved grasps for a
      given model
	\item \strong{get\_alignment} retrieves a saved alignment between
      two models
\end{itemize}

More functions exist, but serve as helpers for those listed above.
