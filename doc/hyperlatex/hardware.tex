\section{Hardware connections}

We have found two main reasons for connecting GraspIt! to hardware
devices. The first one if for GraspIt! to provide output: allow a real
robot to be controlled from within the simulator. Usually, this is
done by having a virtual model of the robot inside GraspIt! that uses
an algorithm running in the simulated environment. The real robot
must then match the pose of its virtual replica. The second
application is to provide input to GraspIt!, in the form of object
geometry from a scanner, object location from a tracker, robot pose,
etc.

For the moment we do not have a unified architecture for connecting
GraspIt! to real world devices. This means that when you need such a
connection, you will probably need to write some interface code
yourself. In the future, we might write a general interface for the
virtual robot to real robot paradigm.

In our work, we have connected GraspIt! to the following external devices:
\begin{itemize}
\item a real Barrett hand
\item a Flock of Birds tracker that can be used to move objects or
  robots in the simulation world
\item a Cyberglove which can be used to provide hand pose input.
\end{itemize}

All the code for these connections is included with the current
distribution. However, it has two shortcomings: first it is
Windows-only. The only reason for that is serial port communication
which he have not yet made cross-platform. The second is that the code
needs a good overhaul to improve its design and robustness.

All the code that is specific to the hardware is offered as a separate
Visual Studio project called \texttt{hardware}. It can be found in
\texttt{\$GRASPIT/hardware}. You will need to compile this project
separately into a static library. Then, inside the main GraspIt!
project file (\texttt{graspit.pro}), indicate that you want GraspIt!
linked against it and its features accessible. This project contains a
simple Serial Port interface that is used by all hardware interfaces,
and interfaces for each of the three pieces of hardware mentioned
above.

The second part of the interface is code that lives within GraspIt!
itself. All of this code is guarded by pre-processor definitions so
that it is only compiled if the \texttt{hardware} project had been
built and linked against. We are really hoping to improve this design
at some point. Most of this functionality is accessible from the
GraspIt! GUI via the Sensors menu.

\subsection{Barrett Hand}

A virtual Barrett hand can be linked to a real Barrett hand. Then, the
pose of the virtual hand can be replicated by the real hand, or vice
versa. The GraspIt! GUI also provide a crude dialog window for doing
this. The Barrett class is a good starting point to check out this
implementation.

\subsection{Flock of Birds}

A Flock of Birds tracker can be used to set the position of any
element (body or robot) in the GraspIt! simulation world. The
following steps must be followed:
\begin{itemize}
\item at load time, the Robot configuration file, or the Body file,
  must specify that the Robot or Body is to be controlled by the Flock
  of Birds. In order to do this, you must also specify where on the
  Robot (or Body) the Flock of Birds sensor is to be mounted. Remember
  that the origin of a body's geometry in GraspIt! is often arbitrary,
  and the location of the sensor makes a huge difference. For
  examples, look at the \texttt{FlockSensor.iv} body file (in
  \texttt{\$GRASPIT/models/objects}) and the \texttt{HumanHand20DOF}
  robot configuration file.
\item using the GraspIt! GUI, you must turn on Flock of Birds
  tracking. When that happens, the GraspIt! world (in the
  \texttt{World} class) will periodically monitor the Flock of Birds
  and ask for an update of its position. Then, it will update the
  position of all the elements in the simulated world that are
  controlled by the flock. See the relevant functions in the
  \texttt{World} class for details.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cyberglove}

A Cyberglove can be used to set the pose of a hand. However, hand
models in GraspIt! do not necessarily have a perfect correspondence
between their DOF's and glove sensors. Therefore, some translation is
necessary, telling the hand which DOF's correspond to which glove
sensors. This functionality is built into the \texttt{GloveInterface}
class. Furthermore, some form of calibration is also needed to map raw
sensor values to DOF values. This turned out to be a very delicate
thing to achieve in practice. The \texttt{GloveInterface} can also
perform calibration for you, then save the calibration to a
file. Similar steps to the Flock of Birds must then be taken:
\begin{itemize}
\item at load time, the Robot configuration file must indicate the
  name of the Cyberglove calibration file that is to be used. See the
  \texttt{HumanHand20DOF} config file for an example.
\item using the GraspIt! GUI, you must turn on Cyberglove
  tracking. When that happens, the GraspIt! world (in the
  \texttt{World} class) will periodically monitor the Cyberglove and
  ask for an update of its sensor readings. Then, it will update the
  pose of all the robots in the simulated world that are controlled by
  the glove. See the relevant functions in the \texttt{World} class
  for details.
\end{itemize}

A calibration file is provided with the \texttt{HumanHand20DOF}
model. We have done our best to calibrate it, but it is a difficult
task, especially for the thumb joints. We have implemented a version
of the algorithm presented by Weston B. Griffin, Ryan P. Findley,
Michael L. Turner and Mark R. Cutkosky, \textit{Calibration and
  Mapping of a Human Hand for Dexterous Telemanipulation}, Haptics
Symposium 2000. However, the calibration code needs a major overhaul
and the calibration itself probably could be improved.
