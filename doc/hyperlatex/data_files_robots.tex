\subsection{Robots}
\label{sec:robotfile}

A Robot is made up of multiple links, connected into kinematic
chains. A link is simply a dynamic body, as described above. A Robot
always has a base link (called "palm" for hands) and one or more
kinematic chains attached to it. Each chain is in turn made up of a
succession of links, connected by joints. In order to define a robot,
two things are needed: the Body files for all the links that are part
of the Robot, plus an overall Robot configuration file, which has all
the kinematic information and references the appropriate body files
for the links. Here we describe the structure of the Robot
configuration file.

Robot configuration files can seem daunting at first, and they are a
bit annoying to get used to. However, you can start from one of the
many robots that are included with this distribution, and use it as a
starting block for your own robot that you are trying to
build. Starting in version 2.1, GraspIt! robot files are now stored in
an XML compatible format.

In general, a Robot configuration file contains the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item the palm - this is simply a pointer to the Body file that
  contains the palm.
\item{degrees of freedom} - contained in the XML tag
  \texttt{\texttt{<dof>}}. We will discuss them in detail below.
\item{kinematic chains} - contained in the XML tag
  \texttt{\texttt{<chain>}}. We will discuss them in detail below.
\end{itemize}

In this example, we will walk through the file for the Robonaut
hand. The first XML tag, \texttt{\texttt{<robot>}}, encloses the entire
contents of the file. It also has a specified property \texttt{type},
which tells GraspIt! whether this is a generic robot or hand or a
particular subclass of one of those. A hand should use the "Hand"
type. In some cases, if a robot has special features or its own
inverse kinematics algorithm, it is necessary to use a subclass of
these generic types, such as "Barrett", or "Puma560":

\begin{verbatim}
<robot type="Robonaut">
... (rest of Robot file)
</robot>
\end{verbatim}

The next item is the filename for the palm link:

\begin{verbatim}
<palm>right_palm.xml</palm>
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Degrees of Freedom}

In each robot file, we have a set of degree of freedom tags
\texttt{\textbf{\texttt{<dof>}}}, each describing one DOF of the robot. Note
that a DOF can be connected to one or more joints in the kinematic
chains, this information will be supplied later in the Robot
configuration file. For more details about DOF's and joints in
GraspIt!, see the \link{Joint Coupling and Underactuated Hands
  chapter}{sec:coupling}. Also note that the \textbf{ORDER} in which
\texttt{<dof>} tags appear in the file is important: dof's will later be
referenced by their position in this order!

For each DOF, the XML tag contains the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \texttt{type} property of the \texttt{<dof>} tag. Its value is a
  letter, showing the DOF type. For the Robonaut hand, all DOF's are
  of the type "rigid", depicted by the letter "r". This is the most
  common type of DOF in GraspIt!. Unless you are building robots with
  coupled joints (multiple joints connected to a single DOF), you can
  always use this type of DOF.
\item all the other properties of the DOF are stored as sub-tags of
  the \texttt{<dof>} tag, as listed below.
\item \texttt{<defaultVelocity>} - the default velocity for that DOF during an
  autograsp operation. This is used to pre-define the "closing" motion
  of a hand. For anthropomorphic hands, these pre-defined directions
  tell GraspIt! how to move each DOF in order to "autograsp", or how
  to "close the hand". This generally means moving the DOF's of the
  MCP, PIP and DIP joints in the "flexing" direction, and no movement
  for the abduction - adduction DOFs.
\item \texttt{<maxEffort>} - the max force the DOF can apply to each joint it
  is connected to. The unit is N * 1.0e6 * mm for torques and N *
  1.0e6 for forces.
\item \texttt{<Kp>} and \texttt{<Kd>} - the Kp and Kv coefficients for a PD force
  controller built into the DOF
\item \texttt{<draggerScale>} - the visual scale of the dragger that allows the
  user to control this DOF through the GraspIt! GUI.
\item a number of optional sub-tags, depending on the DOF type. For
  the "rigid" DOF, no more sub-tags are needed.
\end{itemize}

Here's an example \texttt{<dof>} tag from the Robonaut.xml file:
\begin{verbatim}
    <dof type="r">
        <defaultVelocity>1.0</defaultVelocity>
        <maxEffort>5.0e+9</maxEffort>
        <Kp>1.0e+10</Kp>
        <Kd>1.0e+7</Kd>
        <draggerScale>10</draggerScale>
    </dof>
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Kinematic Chains}

Each kinematic chain is stored in the tag
\texttt{\textbf{chain}}. This tag has no properties, and can contain
the following sub-tags:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{<transform>} - the transform from the origin of the palm (which
  is also the origin of the robot) to the base of this chain, which is
  where the first joint in the chain is placed. Note that, anywhere in
  GraspIt! XML files, a \texttt{<transform>} tag can have an unspecified number
  of sub-tags, each containing a translation, a rotation, or both.
\item \texttt{<joint>} - a joint in the chain. This tag can contain the
  following information:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the joint type, as a property. This can be either
      ``Revolute'' or ``Prismatic''
    \item the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters of this joint, as
      sub-tags:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\texttt{<d>}}
      \item \texttt{<a>}
      \item \texttt{<alpha>}
      \item \texttt{<theta>}
      \item one of the 4 D-H parameters must be connected to a degree
        of freedom of the robot. For revolute joints, this will be
        \texttt{<d>}. For prismatic joints, this will be \texttt{<a>}. For example, to
        show that a revolute joint is connected to the 5th degree of
        freedom of the robot, the XML tag will have the form
        \texttt{\texttt{<d>}d5\texttt{</d>}}.
      \item you can also specify a linear relationship between the DOF
        value and the joint value. This is done in the form d\#*k+c (no
        spaces!). For example, to specify that the value of the joint
        will be one third of the second DOF value, plus an offset of
        30 degrees, the XML tag will have the form:
        \texttt{\texttt{<d>}d2*0.33+30.0\texttt{</d>}}
      \item the other 3 D-H parameters will have fixed values,
        specified in their respective XML tag. Example:
        \texttt{\texttt{<a>}46\texttt{</a>}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{<minValue>} - the lower joint limit for this joint
    \item \texttt{<maxValue>} - the upper joint limit for this joint
    \item other optional sub-tags are also possible, but they are not
      used in this example file, They can contain things like joint
      friction coefficients, spring stiffness etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{<link>} - a link in this chain.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item this tag has a property called ``dynamicJointType''. This
      property tells us how each link is connected to the one
      before. It can be one of the following: "Revolute", "Prismatic",
      "Universal", "Ball", or "Fixed". Depending on which one is used,
      the chain will take some of the joints from the joint list
      above, and put them together to create a connection of that
      type. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Revolute: the link is connected to the one before by
        through a single revolute joint
      \item Universal: the link is connected to the one before by two
        revolute joints, usually with perpendicular axes
      \item Ball: the link is connected to the one before by three
        revolute joints, usually with perpendicular axes
    \end{itemize}
    \item the value of the \texttt{<link>} tag is a pointer to the Body file
      which contains the link.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

            <minValue>0</minValue>
            <maxValue>75</maxValue>
        </joint>
        <link dynamicJointType="Revolute">tyoke.xml</link>
        <link dynamicJointType="Revolute">thumbphl.xml</link>
        <link dynamicJointType="Revolute">thdph1.xml</link>
    </chain>
\end{verbatim}

Finally, the Robot file can contain some optional tags. These usually
includes things such as Eigengrasp information, connection to a Flock
of Birds sensor, etc. These are described in more detail in the
dedicated chapters of this manual.
