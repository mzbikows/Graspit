\section{Soft Fingers}
\label{sec:softFingers}

\htmlmenu{2}

The GraspIt! engine never computes geometry deformation explicitly,
therefore can not find exact contact areas between soft
bodies. However, the frictional implications of soft fingers in
contact are too important to be completely ignored for grasp quality
computations. The most important effect is that contacts over an area
(as opposed to point contacts) can also apply \textbf{torsional
  friction}. The soft finger model in GraspIt! attempts to capture at
least an approximation of this effect, without explicitly computing
the contact deformation. See the \link{Publications}{sec:publications}
section for complete details on the theoretical aspects of our soft
finger contact computation.

In order to designate a body as "soft", specify it's Young's modulus
in the Body XML file (see the \link{Data Files - Bodies}{sec:bodies}
section of this manual for a description of the Body XML files). The
XML tag that should be added is named \texttt{youngs}, and it's value
should be the value of the Young's modulus in Pa. For example, an
entry can have the following form:

\texttt{<youngs>1500000</youngs>}

\subsection{Analytical contact area model}

Any body that has such an entry in the properties section, including
robot links, is treated by GraspIt! as a soft body. When a soft body
is found to contact another body (irrespective of whether the second
body is also soft or not), the contact engine does the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item find a set of vertices on the surface of each body in a small
  area around the contact points. These vertices define the "soft
  neighborhood" of the contact
\item if multiple point contacts are found close to each other, only
  one of them is kept, and their soft neighborhoods are merged
\item fit an analytical surface to the soft neighborhoods. This is
  done by fitting a surface of the form $z=ax^2+by^2+cxy$ to
  the vertices in the neighborhoods
\item the radii of curvature of the analytical surfaces on each body
  are used to approximate the amount of torsional friction that can be
  applied at the contact
\item the Contact Wrench Space is built in order to also contain the
  effect of torsional friction. This wrench space is 4D (unlike the
  Coulomb friction cone which is 3D). Therefore, it can not be
  displayed as a contact marker. Instead, soft contacts are indicated
  by displaying a small patch of the analytical surface fit to each
  body around the contact.
\item the resulting Contact Wrench Space affect both grasp quality
  computations and the behavior of the contact in dynamic simulations.
\end{itemize}

All of this functionality is encapsulated in the \texttt{SoftContact}
class; see the code and documentation of this class for details.

Intuitively, this entire computation has the following effect: if the
bodies are locally "flat", or if their curvatures match in a small
region around the contact, they will produce a larger area of contact
for a given normal force. This will in turn lead to larger torsional
friction. Conversely, sharp edges in contact, even on soft bodies,
will create small torsional friction. The amount of torsional friction
is also influenced by the value of Young's modulus specified for each
body.

This method captures much of the effects of soft contacts on the kind
of simulations that are of primarily interest in GraspIt!. It is
important to note though that it is only an \textbf{approximation} of the
real-life phenomenon. It relies on fitting analytical surfaces to each
of the bodies in a small region around the contact. On bodies with
very complex or degenerate geometry the fitting procedure can fail
leading to incorrect amounts of torsional friction applied. The
fitting procedure also is not very good at handling very sharp
features such as corners or edges.
