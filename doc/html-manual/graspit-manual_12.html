<p>This chapter described the grasp planners that run in Eigengrasp
space. Unfortunately, they do not share the same framework as the
Primitive-based planner described earlier, although from a software
engineering viewpoint they probably should, as they are still rooted
in the same try-many-grasps concept.
</p>
<p>Most of the ideas behind these planners are explained in a lot of
detail in the <a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a>. We strongly
recommend reading the Eigengrasp related papers that can be found there
before proceeding through this chapter, they will make most of the
concepts shown here much clearer.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">12.1 Grasp planning in Eigengrasp space</a></h2><p>
In this family of planners, the task of grasp planning is seen as a
search over multiple variables, or as an optimization problem for a
high-dimensional function. The variables define the grasp and the
optimized function is the quality of the grasp. In general, in order
to define a grasp we need two sets of variables: the intrinsic
variables (to define hand DOF's) and the extrinsic variables, to
define the position of the hand relative to the target object.
</p>
<p>For dexterous hands, if we consider one variable for each DOF, the
space is too high-dimensional to search efficiently. That is why most
of these algorithms only work well in eigengrasp space, where the
intrinsic variables are the eigengrasp amplitudes. However, there is
nothing in the structure of these planners that prevents them from
running in DOF space. In fact, if you load a hand model that does not
have Eigengrasps defined, GraspIt! will automatically define the
"identity" eigengrasp set, with one eigengrasp corresponding to each
DOF. You can then run all Eigengrasp-based planners exactly as you
would if "real" Eigengrasps were defined.
</p>
<p>An Eigengrasp-based planner is composed of three things:
</p>
<ul><li>a set of variables to search over
</li><li>a quality function to optimize over these variables (usually
related in some way to grasp quality)
</li><li>an optimization method (usually Simulated Annealing)
</li></ul>
<p>To start, load a hand and an object model, then use the Grasp <i> -&gt; </i>
EigenGrasp Planner menu. The Eigengrasp Planning dialog window
appears. The left side of the window is dedicated to the variables
that are searched. The right hand side is dedicated to the planning
process itself, allowing you to choose from multiple types of
planners, see details about the current planning execution, etc.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">12.2 Variables</a></h2><p>
All variables that are being searched are shown in the left panel of
the dialog. Variables serve two main purposes: they define hand
position and hand posture.
</p>
<ul><li><b>hand posture</b> is defined using Eigengrasp amplitudes. As
stated above, if the hand you are currently using does not have
other Eigengrasps defined, the planner will just use the "identity"
eigengrasp set. All Eigengrasp variables are shown in the dialog
with the prefix <tt>EG</tt>.
</li><li><b>hand position</b> can be parameterized in many different
ways. The drop down list <tt>Type</tt> offers a number of different
parameterization options. When the selection in this drop-down list
changes, you will see the list of variables change as well. For
complete exhaustive searches, the default option is
<tt>Axis-angle</tt>. In this case hand position is parameterized
using 6 variables: 3 for translation and 3 for rotation. The other
ways of specifying hand position are more specialized; see code and
<a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a> for more details.
</li></ul>
<p>In the GraspIt! code, a state comprising all the variables in search
is contained in the <tt>SearchState</tt> class. Please consult the
documentation of this class for many details about these variables,
different ways to encode hand position, etc.
</p>
<p>Next to each variable, there is an <tt>On</tt> checkbox, which can be
used to enable / disable search over a particular variable. If a
variable is disabled (its box is unchecked), it is no longer part of
the search, and will maintain its current value in all generated
solutions. For each variable, there are also other options marked
<tt>Input</tt>, <tt>Target</tt> and <tt>Confidence</tt>. These options
are used for a very specialized planning operation, using external
input. This type of planning is only described in one of the papers in
the Publications section, and not in this manual. For more
information, please contact us. In general, just ignore these options
and leave them in the default configuration.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">12.3 Search energy</a></h2><p>
The search energy is a way of assessing how good a state encountered
during a search really is. It can also be considered a function of the
search variables that needs to be optimized. The most straightforward
search energy is the one that we have already seen used by the
Primitive-based Grasp Planner: use a grasp Quality Measure. However, a
traditional QM is only defined when the hand is actually in contact
with the object. When planning in Eigengrasp space, many hand states
will be very close, but not in perfect contact with the object. One
possibility would be to use the AutoGrasp function and close the hand,
and compute a QM for the resulting grasp. However, that is a slow
process, and we would like to be able to evaluate more hand postures
quickly. As a result, we have tried to define a number of
implementations of the "Search Energy" concept that do not require
hand-object contacts.
</p>
<p>The default energy function (pre-selected in the <tt>Energy</tt>
formulation drop-down list) is <tt>Hand Contacts</tt>. This
formulation attempts to bring all links of the hand as close as
possible to the target object. The computation of this energy function
can be greatly sped-up by pre-specifying "desired" contact locations
on each link (see <a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a> for
details). This is the role of the checkbox <tt>Preset
contacts</tt>. Such pre-defined contacts can be loaded from a file. For
the Human and Barrett hands, pre-specified contact files are supplied
with the distribution. If no contact file has already been loaded,
when the <tt>Preset contacts</tt> checkbox is checked the system will
ask the user to select a file to be loaded. Note that it is also
possible to specify a pre-defined contacts file in a robot
configuration file, so that it is always loaded together with the
Robot. From a code standpoint, a pre-defined contact location is
loaded into an instance of the <tt>VirtualContact</tt> class; see that
class and its documentation for details.
</p>
<p>Other formulations for the search energy are also available, but many
of them also incorporate the <tt>Hand Contacts</tt> formulation in one
way or another. For the moment, the code implementing these
formulations (the <tt>SearchEnergy</tt> class) is some of the ugliest
in the GraspIt!  codebase. We hope to change it soon, at which point
we will also provide more documentation. For now, the most tested and
trusted energy formulation is Hand Contacts described above.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">12.4 Optimization method and planner types</a></h2><p>
The core optimization methods, that is at the base of all Eigengrasp
planners, is Simulated Annealing. The most basic type of planning is
to run a Simulated Annealing search using the Hand Contacts energy
function, over all Eiegengrasp variables plus hand position
parameterized as axis-angle. This is shown in the practical example
below. From this, we have tried quite a number of variations on this
theme.
</p>
<p>One in particular might prove useful, so it is also exemplified below:
the MultiThreaded Planner. One of the shortcomings of the Hand
Contacts energy function is that is does not guarantee form-closure:
it will find states where the hand conforms to the shape of the
object, but not necessarily form-closed. To fix this, the
MultiThreaded planner runs an optimization exactly as before; however,
whenever it finds a state that has a good value for the Hand Contacts
energy function, it fires off a child thread which will search that
area in more detail, by applying the <tt>AutoGrasp</tt> function and
computing the exact Quality Measure that results. The MultiThreaded
planner is your best bet if you need to find form-closed grasps of an
arbitrary object with one of the dexterous hands in GraspIt!.
</p>
<p>From a code standpoint, the <tt>EGPlanner</tt> pure abstract class is
the base for all of these planners: it contains the functionality for
looping, computing a given hand energy formulation, saving the best
solutions etc. The one thing that it does not know how to do is run an
optimization algorithm. Its direct offspring, the
<tt>SimAnnPlanner</tt> combines that framework with a Simulated
Annealing optimization. To get started, check out the
<tt>EGPlanner</tt> class for most details, and the
<tt>SimAnnPlanner</tt> class for an example implementation of it. All
other planners inherit from <tt>EGPlanner</tt>. The setup for this
code is OK, but could still take quite a bit of improvement, which we
hope to get to at some point.
