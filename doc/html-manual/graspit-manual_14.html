<h1>14 Matlab interface</h1>
</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: The Matlab interface has not been been maintained or
tested recently. We hope to bring it up to date at some point, but for
now you might have to fix it yourself to get it working again.
</p>
<p>On some machines, the GraspIt TCP server segfaults on exit (due to
what seems to be a Qt Socket problem that we have not been able to
track down). Therefore, we have commented it out; if you want to use
this feature you must bring the declaration back. In the file
<tt>&#36;GRASPIT/src/main.cpp</tt>, find the relevant line and uncomment
it.
</p>
<p>When GraspIt! begins, this will start up a TCP server that accepts
connections. A text protocol, which will be described in future
documentation, allows external programs to issue commands and collect
data from the simulation. These programs could run on the same machine
that GraspIt! is running on or on a separate machine. The functions
described in this document allow MATLAB to communicate with
GraspIt. The functions are implemented as C language MEX files. Each
one opens a connection to the GraspIt! server (which for now must be
running on the same machine), issues a command to either change or
query the world state, and closes the connection.
</p>
<p>To use these functions, be sure to set your MATLAB working directory
to the "matlab" folder within the GraspIt root installation
folder. Type "help matlab" to get a summary of the available
functions, and type "help" and the name of a function to find more
detailed information.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">14.1 Commands</a></h2><ul><li><tt>computeNewVelocities</tt> - solves for the new velocity of
each dynamic body
</li><li><tt>getAverageContacts</tt> - returns the average contact force
and position for a body or bodies.
</li><li><tt>getBodyName</tt> - returns the name of a body or bodies.
</li><li><tt>getContacts</tt> - returns all contact forces and positions
for a body or bodies.
</li><li><tt>getDOFVals</tt> - returns the current positions of the
degrees of freedom of a robot or robots.
</li><li><tt>getRobotName</tt> - returns the name of a robot or robots.
</li><li><tt>moveDOFs</tt> - kinematically moves the DOFs of one robot to
desired positions.
</li><li><tt>moveDynamicBodies</tt> - moves every dynamic body by one
timestep or until contact occurs.
</li><li><tt>render</tt> - instructs GraspIt! to render the scene.
</li><li><tt>setDOFForces</tt> - sets the forces acting on the degrees of
freedom of a robot or robots.
</li><li><b>Body related commands</b>: <tt>getAverageContacts,
getBodyName, getContacts</tt> - These commands can be used on a specific
set of bodies if they are given a body index vector, or if none is
supplied they operate on every body currently defined in the
GraspIt! world. The <tt>getBodyName</tt> function can be used
without arguments to see which body corresponds to which index. The
position of the body name in the returned array is the index of the
body in the world.
</li><li><b>Robot related commands</b>: <tt>getDOFVals,
getRobotName, setDOFForces</tt> - These commands can be used on a
specific set of robots if they are given a robot index vector, or if
none is supplied they operate on every robot currently defined in
the GraspIt! world. The <tt>getRobotName</tt> function can be used
without arguments to see which robot corresponds to which index. The
position of the robot name in the returned array is the index of the
robot in the world.
<p>The moveDOFs function requires a single robot index, because GraspIt!
is not setup to kinematically move multiple robots at once.  
</p>
</li><li><b>Dynamics related commands</b>: <tt>moveDynamicBodies,
computeNewVelocities</tt> - These two functions are used to advance the
dynamic simulation by one time step. The user supplies
moveDynamicBodies with a maximum time step, and the fuction moves
each body along its current trajectory for that amount of
time. However, if a contact occurs during that period, the function
moves the bodies up to that point, adds the new contact, and returns
the amount of time that passed until the event occurred. A similar
process occurrs a joint limit is reached. The time value returned
should be passed to the <tt>computeNewVelocities</tt> command when
it is called. This command solves for the impulses acting on each
body and the resulting velocity of each body given the current
constraints.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id2">14.2 One time step</a></h2><p>
A script that performs a dynamic simulation will contain a loop, where
each iteration of the loop advances the simulation by one time
step. The following is a possible example script:
</p>
<pre>
%the maximum time step is commonly 2.5 milliseconds
maxdt = 0.0025;  
      		
while 1
  % advance the simulation	
  h = moveDynamicBodies(maxdt);
  computeNewVelocities(h);
      		  
  % compute the control forces
  %where 6 9 12 are the indices of the fingertip bodies
  [CF,CP] = getAverageContacts([6; 9; 12]);  

  DP = getDOFVals;
  DF = computeControlForces(DP,CF,CP);
  %This would be a user supplied function that computes the new
  %DOF forces based on the current DOF positions, the contact forces,
  %and positions.

  setDOFForces(DF);   
  %the computed forces are applied to the bodies and will affect 
  %the next velocity computation.
end
