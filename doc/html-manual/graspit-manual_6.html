<ul>
<li><a href="#id1">6.1 Analytical contact area model</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The GraspIt! engine never computes geometry deformation explicitly,
therefore can not find exact contact areas between soft
bodies. However, the frictional implications of soft fingers in
contact are too important to be completely ignored for grasp quality
computations. The most important effect is that contacts over an area
(as opposed to point contacts) can also apply <b>torsional
friction</b>. The soft finger model in GraspIt! attempts to capture at
least an approximation of this effect, without explicitly computing
the contact deformation. See the <a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a>
section for complete details on the theoretical aspects of our soft
finger contact computation.
</p>
<p>In order to designate a body as "soft", specify it's Young's modulus
in the Body XML file (see the <a href="graspit-manual_4.html#sec:bodies">Data Files - Bodies</a>
section of this manual for a description of the Body XML files). The
XML tag that should be added is named <tt>youngs</tt>, and it's value
should be the value of the Young's modulus in Pa. For example, an
entry can have the following form:
</p>
<p><tt>&lt;youngs&gt;1500000&lt;/youngs&gt;</tt>
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">6.1 Analytical contact area model</a></h2><p>
Any body that has such an entry in the properties section, including
robot links, is treated by GraspIt! as a soft body. When a soft body
is found to contact another body (irrespective of whether the second
body is also soft or not), the contact engine does the following:
</p>
<ul><li>find a set of vertices on the surface of each body in a small
area around the contact points. These vertices define the "soft
neighborhood" of the contact
</li><li>if multiple point contacts are found close to each other, only
one of them is kept, and their soft neighborhoods are merged
</li><li>fit an analytical surface to the soft neighborhoods. This is
done by fitting a surface of the form <i>z=ax<sup>2</sup>+by<sup>2</sup>+cxy</i> to
the vertices in the neighborhoods
</li><li>the radii of curvature of the analytical surfaces on each body
are used to approximate the amount of torsional friction that can be
applied at the contact
</li><li>the Contact Wrench Space is built in order to also contain the
effect of torsional friction. This wrench space is 4D (unlike the
Coulomb friction cone which is 3D). Therefore, it can not be
displayed as a contact marker. Instead, soft contacts are indicated
by displaying a small patch of the analytical surface fit to each
body around the contact.
</li><li>the resulting Contact Wrench Space affect both grasp quality
computations and the behavior of the contact in dynamic simulations.
</li></ul>
<p>All of this functionality is encapsulated in the <tt>SoftContact</tt>
class; see the code and documentation of this class for details.
</p>
<p>Intuitively, this entire computation has the following effect: if the
bodies are locally "flat", or if their curvatures match in a small
region around the contact, they will produce a larger area of contact
for a given normal force. This will in turn lead to larger torsional
friction. Conversely, sharp edges in contact, even on soft bodies,
will create small torsional friction. The amount of torsional friction
is also influenced by the value of Young's modulus specified for each
body.
</p>
<p>This method captures much of the effects of soft contacts on the kind
of simulations that are of primarily interest in GraspIt!. It is
important to note though that it is only an <b>approximation</b> of the
real-life phenomenon. It relies on fitting analytical surfaces to each
of the bodies in a small region around the contact. On bodies with
very complex or degenerate geometry the fitting procedure can fail
leading to incorrect amounts of torsional friction applied. The
fitting procedure also is not very good at handling very sharp
features such as corners or edges.
