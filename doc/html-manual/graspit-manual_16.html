<h2><a name="id1">16.1 Overview</a></h2><p>
The Columbia Grasp Database (CGDB) is a repository of more than
250,000 grasps over a set of approximately 8,000 3D models. The
interface discussed here allows you to load these models into GraspIt,
load and inspect the grasps for these objects stored in the database
and use them for data-drive, machine-learning based algorithms inside
GraspIt.
</p>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to the interface between the CGDB and
GraspIt. It will show you how to install and use this interface. The
next chapter, <a href="graspit-manual_17.html">The Columbia Grasp Database - Part II</a>,
presents the database itself in much more detail, discusses some of
its design choices, shows you how to extend it, etc. Finally, see the
<a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a> section for a complete
discussion of theoretical aspects and research questions.
</p>
<p>Formally, the database contains:
</p>
<ul><li>the set of objects used is the Princeton Shape Benchmark
(PSB). This set consists of approx. 1800 3D models, and is
separate from GraspIt. However, it is freely available for
download (see below for installation instructions).
</li><li>since grasping is inherently scale-dependant, in the CGDB,
each of these 1,800 models is used at 4 different
scales. Therefore, the CGDB can be considered to use
approx. 1,800 * 4 = 7,200 individual 3D models.
</li><li>for each of these models, the CGDB contains a number of
grasps. A grasp is defined as:
<ul><li>a hand position relative to the object
</li><li>a set of hand joint angles
</li></ul>
</li><li>quality metrics for all the grasps. Note that all of the
</li><li>hand-object contact points for all the grasps, for use in
machine learning grasps from the CGDB have form-closure.
</li><li>grasps have been stored in the database for 3 hand models:
<ul><li>the Barrett hand assuming plastic finger covers (low
friction coefficient)
</li><li>the Barrett hand assuming rubber finger covers (high
friction coefficient)
</li><li>the Human Hand model
</li></ul>
</li><li>in total, the CGDB contains more than 250,000 grasps.
</li></ul>
<p>The interface between GraspIt and the CGDB will enable you to:
</p>
<ul><li>load any model from the PSB into GraspIt!, automatically
rescaled to a size appropriate for grasping.
</li><li>see the other models in the PSB that are "geometrically
similar" to the loaded model.
</li><li>load the grasps for that model that have been saved in the
CGDB, using any of the three hand models above.
</li><li>use this information for data-driven grasp planning.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id2">16.2 Caveats</a></h2><p>
An aspect of particular importance concerns the quality of the
information available in the CGDB. Many of the objects in the PSB are
not intuitively graspable. You will find extensive sets of ants and
spiders, battleships, furniture etc. For the purposes of the CGDB, all
objects have been rescaled to what we empirically considered to be
"graspable" size. Informally, this is approximately the size of a toy model
of the object.
</p>
<p>Since the majority of the grasps in the database were found using an 
<b>automated planner</b>, not all of the grasps are truly humanlike or
reliable. There can be cases where a grasp satisfies our quality
metrics, but would require a degree of precision that cannot be
obtained in real-life execution. Aside from the intrinsic limitations
of grasp quality metrics, for which there is as of yet no firm
consensus on which to use, our approach to grasp planning is purely
geometric. This presents problems for objects that do not match our
assumptions. For example, our assumption that all objects are rigid
plastic results in geometrically correct but unrealistic grasps on
objects such as flowers or leaves. Furthermore, the lack of
domain-specific knowledge means that some of our grasps are
semantically incorrect, such as a mug grasped by placing the fingers
inside.
</p>
<p>Finally, our automatically computed grasps were obtained from pre-grasps that
sample a low-dimensional subspace of the hand DOF space. This is for the moment
a necessary simplification, without which the planning problem for
dexterous hands is intractable at this scale. While our choice of
subspace is theoretically justified and shown to be effective [3], we
cannot reasonably claim that the database covers the entire space of
possible grasps.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">16.3 Database installation</a></h2><p>
The CGDB comes as a separate download from GraspIt!, at the
<a href="http://grasping.cs.columbia.edu/">Columbia Robotics
website</a>. It is available for
download as a PostgreSQL database backup file (70M) and requires a PostgreSQL
installation to use. In order to use the interface presented here, you
will need to install a PostgreSQL server on your machine and load the
provided backup file. PostgreSQL is open source, and easy to
install. We recommend getting the binary package.
</p>

<h2><a name="sec:cgdbinterface">16.4 GraspIt Interface Installation</a></h2>

<h3><a name="id5">Windows</a></h3><ul><li>Download PostgreSQL from the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL
website</a> and install. We recommend
installing the binary package.
<ul><li>add <tt>&#36;PSQLDIR/bin</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt>, where
<tt>&#36;PSQLDIR</tt> is the directory where you installed PostgreSQL
(<i>e.g.</i> <tt>C:/postgresql-8.3.4</tt>).
</li><li>WARNING: if Qt can not find the PostgreSQL dll's it will NOT
complain about it, but just fail to open any databases. If that
happens, make sure the path to the dll is in your <tt>PATH</tt>.
</li><li>WARNING: some of the dll's from <tt>&#36;PSQLDIR/bin</tt> are
sometimes also present in other places on your system, such as
<tt>Windows/system32</tt> etc. For some reason, the system will try
to use the wrong version at run-time and <tt>libpq</tt> won't
operate well. If this happens, you will get a "driver not loaded"
error from the GraspIt CGDB interface. The solution is to copy some
of the dll's from <tt>&#36;PSQLDIR/bin</tt> to the directory that
you're running GraspIt from (<tt>&#36;GRASPIT</tt> if running from
Visual Studio or <tt>&#36;GRASPIT/bin</tt> if running the executable
directly). For example, I have had to do this with
<tt>libeay32.dll</tt> and <tt>ssleay32.dll</tt>.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Build the <tt>qpsql</tt> according to "How to Build the QPSQL
Plugin on Windows" in the Qt Assistant:
<ul><li><tt>cd &#36;QTDIR/src/plugins/sqldrivers/psql</tt>
</li><li><tt>qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=&#36;PSQLDIR/include"
"LIBS+=&#36;PSQLDIR/lib/libpq.lib" psql.pro</tt>
</li><li><tt>nmake</tt>
</li><li>after this, check that the qsqlpsql lib and dll files have been
built in <tt>&#36;QTDIR/plugins/sqldrivers</tt>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Create your root for the CGDB, such as <tt>C:/cgdb</tt>. Set the
environment variable <tt>CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT</tt> to point to it.
</li><li>download the <a href="http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/download.cgi?file=download/psb&#95;v1.zip">Princeton Shape
Benchmark</a>
and unpack it in to <tt>&#36;CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT/psb</tt>.
<ul><li>for example, the model <tt>m0</tt> should be in
<tt>&#36;CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT/psb/benchmark/db/0/m0/m0.off</tt>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Enable the CGDB by uncommenting the appropriate line in the
<tt>graspit.pro</tt> file and rebuild GraspIt.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="id6">Linux</a></h3><ul><li>install the SQL module for Qt. Using the Package Manager,
install the package <tt>libqt4-sql</tt>.
</li><li>Create your root for the CGDB, such as <tt>/data/cgdb</tt>. Set
the environment variable <tt>CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT</tt> to point to it.
</li><li>download the <a href="http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/download.cgi?file=download/psb&#95;v1.zip">Princeton Shape Benchmark</a>
and unpack it in to <tt>&#36;CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT/psb</tt>.
<ul><li>for example, the model <tt>m0</tt> should be in
<tt>&#36;CGDB&#95;MODEL&#95;ROOT/psb/benchmark/db/0/m0/m0.off</tt>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Enable the CGDB by uncommenting the appropriate line in the
<tt>graspit.pro</tt> file and rebuild GraspIt.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id7">16.5 Connecting to and browsing the database</a></h2><p>Connecting to the CGDB:
</p>
<ul><li>start GraspIt and load one of the hand models that are used in
the CGDB (the Human hand or the Barrett hand). You don't need to
explicitly load any objects.
</li><li>The Database menu gives you access to all CGDB functionality
from GraspIt. The first step is to establish a connection to the
CGDB, using the Database <i> -&gt; </i> Connect and Browse
menu. After a connection is established, you can use the other
functions in the Database menu as well. Click Database <i> -&gt; </i>
Connect and Browse to bring up the CGDB-Browser dialog.
</li><li>set the connection parameters based on PostgreSQL server that
you are connecting to. You must have access to a machine running a
PostgreSQL server that serves the CGDB, as downloaded above. Most
often, the machine running the server will be the same that GraspIt
is running on; in this case, set the Host to <tt>localhost</tt>. The
Port number is usually 5432. Set the User Name and Password based on
the settings that you used when setting up your PostgreSQL server.
</li><li>note that it is also possible to connect to a remote machine
running the PostgreSQL server. In the future, we might set up a
machine in the Columbia Robotics lab that will offer a read-only
version of the database for everybody. For now though, you have to
set up your own PostgreSQL server.
</li><li>click <tt>Connect</tt>. If the connection is successful, the
<tt>Browser</tt> group will become enabled, the <tt>Models</tt>
drop-down list will be populated with a list of models and the
currently selected model thumbnail will be shown in the dedicated
space.
</li><li>if the connection fails, you will get an error message in the
console. Usually, this error message will say that the Qt SQL driver
is not properly loaded. Go back to the <a href="#sec:cgdbinterface">Interface
Installation</a> section for details.
</li></ul>
<p>Browsing the CGDB:
</p>
<ul><li>select a model from the <tt>Models</tt> drop-down list. The
model's thumbnail will be shown. Note that the names of the models
from the PSB are set as follows: psb&#95;scale&#95;modelnumber. Each model
can be selected at one of four different scales (<tt>0.75, 1.0,
1.25 or 1.5</tt>, each compared to a reference size which has been
determined empirically by us).
</li><li>click <tt>Load Model</tt>. The model will be loaded into GraspIt
and set as the reference object for grasp quality computations.
</li><li>select the type of grasps that you want to load. There are three
grasp types stored in the database:
<ul><li><tt>EIGENGRASPS</tt> - this is the actual database, the grasps
computed by our automatic planner. You will find this type of
grasps for all the objects in the database. We recommend using
only this type of grasps when using the CGDB.
</li><li><tt>HUMAN</tt> - grasps created by a human operator. This are
being used for a current unfinished project in the Columbia
Robotics Lab. For the moment, there are very few grasps of this
type saved in the CGDB, approx 100 grasps over a set of 15
objects. In the future, the CGDB might include more grasps of this
type, for comparison against the automatically generated grasps
above.
</li><li><tt>HUMAN&#95;REFINED</tt> - the same operator-created grasps,
but further refined inside GraspIt by an operator. Again, very few
of these are available.
</li></ul>
</li><li>click <tt>Load Grasps</tt> and use the <tt>Grasps</tt> button
group to browse the loaded grasps. Note that, for each grasp, you
can look at either the final grasp posture, or the pre-grasp. See
the CGDB Publications for the difference between these two.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id8">16.6 Geometric similarity</a></h2><p>
A very important aspect of the CGDB concerns geometric similarity
between objects. Our group has been implementing existing tools, and
also developing new methods for this area. These tools are not
included with GraspIt! - this means that, if you have a <b>new 3D
model</b>, this interface will not be able to find its geometric
"neighbors" in the CGDB. However, we have <b>precomputed</b> this
information for all the models that are already part of the CGDB, and
<b>included</b> this information in the CGDB. This means that, for
any model in the CGDB, you can see which other models are
"geometrically similar" based on our set of tools.
</p>
<p>Geometric similarity is a vibrant research area, far exceeding the
scope of this user manual. For more details, please see the
<a href="graspit-manual_18.html">Publications</a> section.
</p>

<h2><a name="id9">16.7 Database-backed grasp planning</a></h2><p>
Database-backed grasp planning works by finding geometrically similar
"neighbor" objects to the target object in the CGDB. Due to the
reasons explained above, the version of the planner included with this
distribution only works for models that are <b>already in the
CGDB</b> and as such have pre-computed neighbor information. However,
we are providing this code in the hope that it will serve as a
blueprint for developing your own CGDB-backed algorithms.
</p>
<p>Please note that this is a fairly complex machinery, and all the
details of its execution exceed the scope of this chapter. More
information is provided in the next chapter, which discusses advanced
concepts pertaining to the CGDB. You might need to peruse the code
itself, and its documentation for more details.
</p>
<p>To start, use the following steps:
</p>
<ul><li>establish a connection to the CGDB as discussed above.
</li><li>load a model from the CGDB. This will serve as the target
object, the one that we will plan grasps on.
</li><li>start the planner using the Database <i> -&gt; </i> Database
Planner menu.
</li></ul>
<p>The CGDB Planner goes through a few steps, each with its own dedicated
button group in the Planner dialog.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Neighbor Generator</b>
<ul><li>select the distance function used for finding geometric
neighbors. Use <tt>SIFT&#95;12&#95;view&#95;0</tt> for our most up-to-date
results on shape search. For more details, please see the CGDB
publications.
</li><li>choose the number of neighbors you want to use. Usually, a
number between 3 and 5 does the job, but you can choose to use
more of fewer neighbors based on your computational
resources. Note that the more neighbors you use, the worse the
"geometric matching" will get.
</li><li>click <tt>Get Neighbors</tt>. The drop-down list of neighbors
will be populated and you can browse through it and see the
associated thumbnails.
</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Alignment</b> - Choose a method for aligning neighbors to
the original model. <tt>SIFT&#95;PI&#95;ICP&#95;FULL</tt> gives the best
results.
</li><li><b>Grasp retrieval and ranking</b>. Here we retrieve the
grasps from the neighbors and rank them. Click <tt>Retrieve
Grasps</tt>. Currently, the ranking methods we are using are still
under development, so choose <tt>No ranking</tt>, then click
<tt>Rank Grasps</tt>. After you have done this, the <tt>Selected
Grasps</tt> group should become enabled, and the counter will show you
the total number of grasps retrieved from neighbors.
</li><li><b>Grasp Browsing</b> - you can browse through the list of
retrieved grasps in the <tt>Selected Grasps</tt> group. Make sure
that <tt>aligned original grasp</tt> is selected.
</li><li><b>Grasp execution</b> - here we execute the retrieved grasps
on the target object, and compute their quality. Make sure
<tt>Static</tt> is selected in the grasp execution type drop down
box (the other option, <tt>Dynamic</tt> execution, is still under
development). You can test the grasps one at a time, by selecting
<tt>Test current</tt>, or all at once, by selecting <tt>Test
All</tt>. Note that this option will usually take up to a minute of
computation, depending on the number of neighbors and the number of
retrieved grasps.
</li><li><b>Solution inspection</b> - after using the <tt>Test All</tt>
option, you can browse the results of the planner, sorted by
quality. Use the <tt>Selected Grasps</tt> group, but this time
select <tt>tested grasps</tt> in the radio box.
</li></ul>
<p>This is just a very high-level overview and walk-through for the
CGDB-backed planner. For more details, please see the next chapter of
this manual, the source code documentation, the Publications chapter,
or contact us.
